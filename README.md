# Object Tracking 
---
Object tracking is Deep learning problem. In this we need to track the moving object in videos feeds. 
Tracking has two parts
 - Detect Object 
 - Track Object
 
 - First we need to detect object and  lock by using any object detection algorithm (SSD or Haar etc) that object for tracking.
 - Tracking is the process of tracking the co-ordinates of moving object.

Pre-requisite.
 - Python
 - OpenCV
 - Pre-train model like Caffe or TensorFlow
